# Wine-Quality-Analysis

About the Dataset
There are two datasets that provide information on samples of red and white variants of the Portuguese "Vinho Verde" wine. 
Each sample of wine was rated for quality by wine experts and examined with physicochemical tests. 
Due to privacy and logistic issues, only data on these physicochemical properties and quality ratings are available 
(e.g. there is no data about grape types, wine brand, wine selling price, etc.).


Attribute Information:

Input variables (based on physicochemical tests):
1 - fixed acidity
2 - volatile acidity
3 - citric acid
4 - residual sugar
5 - chlorides
6 - free sulfur dioxide
7 - total sulfur dioxide
8 - density
9 - pH
10 - sulphates
11 - alcohol
Output variable (based on sensory data):
